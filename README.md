=========

SimServer is a Play 2.x-based web application centered around allowing scalable, low-friction distribution of NetLogo into classroom environments for aiding in the research efforts of the [ModelSim grant](http://ccl.northwestern.edu/modelsim/).  The application provides an API for generating Java WebStart JNLPs, an API for storing NetLogo logging data, a HubNet connection streamliner, and a subsystem for uploading, discussing, and forking user work.
